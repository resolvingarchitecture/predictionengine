# StyleLogic Sutter Mill Prediction Engine v2
Original prediction engine for Review Movies from StyleLogic of 
Solana Beach (San Diego) developed originally by John and James Skrinska in 2001. 
Cleaned up to a v2 by introducing idiomatic Java, updating Java from 1.1
to 11, and backing it with the H2 in-memory database. The original SQL was
not with the application so had to be determined.
