# StyleLogic Sutter Mill Prediction Engine v2
Original prediction engine for Review Movies from StyleLogic of Solana Beach 
(San Diego) developed originally by John and James Skrinska in 2001 
partially cleaned up to a v2 by introducing idiomatic Java, updating Java 
from 1.1 to 11, backing it with the H2 in-memory database, and moving its 
structure to a more clean layout. The hopes was to re-thread it to distribute 
the heaviest loads to improve scalability. The original SQL was not with the 
application so had to be determined. Decided to let old dead cats lie and 
create a new updated KMeansSquare service independent of this example.
